You've found this little "secret" page. Congratulations.</i></p><p>It would be very easy for me to take credit for the entire project (with the obvious exception of the game itself, which I don't own). My knowledge of web development was largely "self-taught" and no one else directly collaborated on the project.</p><p>However, upon further reflection, almost all of what make the website function IS someone else's work:</p><ul><li>The user interface (what you see) was made with <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, which was created by Facebook. I don't think I could have done this without React or something similar.</li><li>The server (what does the back-end work and synchronizes the games) was made with <a href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>. At the time of writing this I have 872 "packages" in the project, which are scripts that either add functionality or simplify tasks. I don't know how many different people contributed to making all those work and I <em>certainly</em> could not have made a functional web server without packages like Express.</li><li>The website is on a platform called <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a>, which hosts projects like this for free. I did not buy a domain or my own physical server.</li><li>And, of course, I don't actually own the game of Homeworlds; it is published by <a href="https://www.looneylabs.com">Looney Labs</a>.</li></ul><p>Still, the first two items there are rather obvious to anyone who does software development. But if I look even deeper, there's a lot more to the foundation than is immediately apparent:</p><ul><li>I did not invent HTML and CSS, the languages that tell the web browser how to turn a bunch of files into what you see now.</li><li>I did not create Chromium, the browser that I used to test this project, nor <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a>, the basis for the operating system of my computer <small>(actually I use <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> which is a further spin-off from GNU/Linux)</small>, nor <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, the text editor that I typed all this code on.</li><li>When I didn't know how to do a specific thing, I would do a search on a website called <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>, and from there find information on websites like <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, or others. All of those websites got their content from real people selflessly devoting their time to create informative content.</li><li>The computer that I am writing this on was given to me as a gift; it was not something I bought.</li><li>And that computer only works because my city provides electrical power and broadband Internet connectivity with remarkable consistency.</li><li>And finally, I live in a relatively safe city, in part because of the public investments, like the police department* and infrastructure and transportation.</li></ul><p><small>*Obviously they aren't perfect and should be reformed, because the sense of safety that I have experienced isn't universal.</small></p><p>If you really think about it, there is a lot that went in to this project that I cannot possibly take credit for. It would be wrong of me to attribute it <strong>purely</strong> to hard work, talent, and character (and even those ultimately come from God), and ignore all the external factors that went into it.</p><p>So the next time some you read something about how [insert rich person here] struggled and climbed their way to riches, remember, it's really a combination of skill and luck, of the internal and the external, that determines success.</p></div> <%- include("footer") %> <script src="/scripts/vendor.js?6a8538a8428e91cc6814"></script></body></html>
