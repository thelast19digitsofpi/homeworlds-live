It does not cover how to play the game of Homeworlds in general. For that, go <a href="/tutorial">here</a>.</h6><h5 class="text-warning">It is especially important to read the bullet points in orange.</h5><br/><h3>Lobby</h3><h5>Joining Rooms</h5><ul><li>In the lobby you can create game rooms or join rooms that exist already.</li><li>In the "join a game" view, click on a row to view details. From there you can join the room.</li><li><strong>Sometimes players are invited into rooms</strong>. Invitees get priority over non-invitees.</li><li>If you are invited, the room will appear orange in the table.</li></ul><h5>Creating Rooms</h5><ul><li>Click the "Create a game instead" button in the lobby to create a room. You can specify the time control, make the game unrated, and choose specific players to invite.</li><li>Only 2-player games are supported, but you can invite more than one player (first come first serve).</li></ul><h5>Launch Sequence</h5><ul><li>The owner of a room (whoever has been in it the longest) can decide to start a game.</li><li>All players in the room must agree to start. If anyone declines, the start sequence is blocked.</li><li>When everyone (including the owner) confirms, the game starts.</li></ul><p>You can also watch games in progress by clicking the links in the lobby.</p><h3>In Game</h3><h5>Colorblind Mode</h5><ul><li>This puts the symbols <strong class="text-primary">&#x21c6;</strong>, <strong class="text-success">+</strong>, <strong class="text-yellow">&#x2227;</strong>, and <strong class="text-danger">&#x2734;</strong> on all ships and stars.</li><li>Yellow ships have the movement symbol (<strong class="text-yellow">&#x2227;</strong>) repeated 1, 2, or 3 times instead of pips.</li><li>Other colors have white symbols and black pips (except small ships, where the pips were removed).</li></ul><h5>Turns</h5><ul><li>When it is your turn, the border of the star map will turn white.</li><li>Click pieces on the board and stash to do actions (see below).</li><li class="text-warning">When you are finished, <strong>you must click "End Turn"!</strong></li><ul><li>Also, if you leave the turn in dangerous situations, <strong class="text-warning">a warning will appear below the star map</strong> and you must <strong>confirm you want to end your turn</strong>.</li><li>This can be disabled by un-checking the Warnings checkbox on the lower right.</li></ul><li>If you mess up, you can click "Reset Turn" to undo your actions. You may use this any number of times.</li><li>Once you click End Turn, you may no longer undo it.</li></ul><h5>Specific Actions</h5><p>Most of the actions are pretty intuitive (except perhaps building and homeworld setup), but here is the list of what to do:</p><ul><li><strong class="text-dark">Homeworld Setup</strong>: Click your two stars first, then your ship. They are displayed below the star map. Use "Reset Turn" if you make a mistake.</li><li><strong class="text-success">Building</strong>: <span class="text-warning">First click on a ship of the same color</span> in the intended system, then click the Build button. (Example: if you want to build a red at your homeworld, click a red ship you already have there.)</li><li><strong class="text-primary">Trading</strong>: Click the ship you want to trade, click the "Trade" button, then click a stash piece.</li><li><strong class="text-yellow">Movement</strong>: Click the ship you want to move, click the "Move/Discover" button, then click any piece at the target system.</li><li><strong class="text-yellow">Discovery</strong>: Like movement, but click a piece in the stash.</li><li><strong class="text-danger">Capturing</strong>: Click the enemy ship, then the Capture button.</li><li><strong class="text-info">Sacrificing</strong>: Click the ship to sacrifice, then the Sacrifice button. Then do your sacrifice actions as above.</li><li><strong class="text-info">Catastrophes</strong>: Click any piece of the overpopulated color at the system, then the catastrophe button.</li></ul><h5>Game End</h5><ul><li><strong class="text-warning">You must click "End Turn", even on the game-winning move!</strong></li><li>You can also offer a draw. If your opponent offers a draw, you can click the offer button to accept, or reject it.</li><li>Threefold repetition is not enforced (but that is on my list).</li><li>However, mutual destruction DOES result in a draw.</li><li>When the game ends, you have the option to copy a log of the game. <strong>Currently, the games are NOT backed up to the server.</strong></li></ul><h5>Some Quirks</h5><ul><li>If you set a timed game, <strong class="text-warning">the clock is completely unforgiving</strong>. Either play with a comfortable delay or increment, or else make sure your internet connection is strong.</li><li><strong class="text-warning">The map may rearrange dramatically if half a homeworld is destroyed</strong>, and also rearranges when systems become contested (i.e. occupied by both players).</li><ul><li>This is mostly because right now the stars are positioned by a simple algorithm that has no memory of previous arrangements.</li><li>You may actually find this useful (because it emphasizes that things are different).</li><li>It might help to pay attention to the system numbers.</li></ul><li><strong class="text-warning">If you <em>disconnect</em> for more than 7.5 minutes, you forfeit the game</strong> even if it is not timed.</li><li>If you do the game-winning catastrophe or capture, but do not click "End Turn" until after your clock expires, <strong>the game is considered a draw</strong>.</li><li>I do not officially support mobile although it seems to work (though it has been subject to some bugs).</li></ul></div> <%- include("footer") %> <script src="/scripts/vendor.js?a1df9c4e2136994752b1"></script></body></html>
